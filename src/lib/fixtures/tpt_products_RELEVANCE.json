    "description": "<p>Celebrate cultural diversity in your classroom while supporting your students to develop their communication skills, understanding of others and appreciation for cultures around the world through 'My Culture Project'.  This printable culture project for kids contains space for your students to share their <strong>country, flag, languages, favourite traditional foods, a description of a special occasion they celebrate with their family, traditional outfits and other interesting facts</strong> about their culture.  This multicultural classroom activity is a 5 page booklet which can then be used for an oral presentation and/or classroom display exploring and celebrating the diversity within your class community.  The resource also includes 4 printable worksheets for exploring class cultures further, and a display suggestion with accompanying template and banner lettering.  Use this culture project as a heritage month activity, back to school activity, cultural awareness week activity or as part of your Ethical Education Curriculum (e.g. 'Learn Together' or 'GMGY')</p><p></p><p>Your students could complete the world cultures booklet in school or as a family project at home.  The children could then share their booklets with each other in pairs, groups or as a presentation for the class.  This would provide <strong>a fantastic opportunity to talk about cultural diversity</strong> within the class.  These booklets could also be added to your classroom library so the children can learn more about each other throughout the year.  You could use these templates as a stand alone project or as part of a Conceptual Enquiry based on culture and traditions.</p><p></p><p>Includes UK and US spellings (favourite/favorite).</p><p></p><p>If you would like to see some of the other resources that I love using with my students, check out my instagram account at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ciarasclassroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ciarasclassroom</a>.</p><p></p><p><em>Also, I would really appreciate it if you could leave a review for this product on my store.

It is a really useful feedback form for a substitute teacher/relief teacher to fill out and leave for the class teacher after subbing in their classroom. The form is clear, quick and easy to fill out and provides the class teacher with an overview of the day, any children who deserve recognition and praise for their exceptional behaviour and kindness, children who needed extra reminders/attention, and a record of attendance. There is also an extra space at the bottom for any additional notes or comments.  This is the ideal addition to any substitute teacher's subbing toolkit and a perfect way to leave a great first impression as a substitute/relief teacher!</p><p></p><p>If you would like to see some of the other resources that I love using with my students, check out my instagram account at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ciarasclassroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ciarasclassroom</a>.</p><p></p><p><em>Also, I would really appreciate it if you could leave a review for this product on my store.

The form is clear, quick and easy to fill out and provides the class teacher with an overview of the day, any children who were exceptionally well behaved, children who needed extra reminders/attention, and a record of attendance. There is also an extra space at the bottom for any additional notes or comments.</li><li><strong>Circle Time Conversation Starter Cards:  </strong>This set of conversation starter cards is perfect for facilitating and promoting positive intercultural dialogue in diverse classrooms.

The team building activities are fun and engaging teamwork games for elementary aged students and are ideal for teachers as they require minimal resources (hula hoops, blocks, a marble/ball, sheets of paper).</li><li><strong>Word Searches:</strong>  Two sets of differentiated word searches (6 in total) with solutions/answer keys provided for each one.</li></ul><p></p><p>If you would like to see some of the other resources that I love using with my students, check out my instagram account at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ciarasclassroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@ciarasclassroom</a>.</p><p></p><p><em>Also, I would really appreciate it if you could leave a review for this product on my store.

These booklets could also be added to your classroom library so the children can learn more about each other throughout the year.</p><p></p><p>This social studies resource works well for exploring Heritage and Identity.
