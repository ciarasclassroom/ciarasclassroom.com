Today the kids worked in teams to create a poster to show different lengths, sort based on length and then label the shortest and longest piece. Very simple but great for encouraging maths talk and teamwork skills. Each group presented their ‘project’ afterwards. \n\n#mathlesson #mathskills #seniorinfants #mathstalk #kidsproject #classroomideas #instateacher #teachergram #teacherideas #learningisfun #lessonplanning #irishprimaryteacher #earlyyears #teachersoninstagram",

Each child gets their own sheet with a section of the image. After colouring in their pieces, each page gets stuck together to create the full display. The pack comes with 4-piece, 9-piece, 15-piece and 28-piece versions. 🖍️ Available now in my TPT store! 💛 #MLKDay #inclusiveclassroom #teachersofinstagram #ciarasclassroom #inclusiveeducation #teachertalk #martinlutherkingjr #classroomideas #teacherideas #teachergram #teachersofinstagram",

Here are some ideas inspired by ‘Kenny Lives with Erica and Martina’ by @popnollyuk . In my school, we have a full set of all picture books from Pop n Olly and I honestly think they are a brilliant addition to any school’s library! \n\n#lessonideas #inclusiveeducation #muinteoir #lessonplanning #teachershare #teachergram #teachersofinstagram #teachingisaworkofheart #lifelessons #globalcitizen #childrensrights #edutalk #learntogether",
