We have a blank copy with no lines for â€˜Gaeilgeâ€™, a wide lined copy for â€˜Writingâ€™, a project copy (lines and blank space at the top for drawings) for â€˜Newsâ€™, a blank copy with no lines for â€˜Topicsâ€™ (a combo of Aistear, SESE, Learn Together, fine motor and other thematic work) and a small lined notebook for â€˜Dictationâ€™ (assessment of/for learningâ€¦5 words once a week/fortnight based on the sounds weâ€™ve been working on recently). \n\nWe have two workbooks; â€˜Operation Mathsâ€™ and â€˜Sounds Make Wordsâ€™. I find both of these books beneficial. We use the most helpful pages but donâ€™t put pressure on ourselves to complete every page as hands on activities are often more beneficial than completing a page for the sake of having the page done. \n\n#seniorinfants #schoolbooks #classroomsetup #bookboxes #myclassroom #mÃºinteoir #elementaryteacher #primaryschoolteacher #teachershare #teacherlife #teachersfollowingteachers",

    "caption": "Do you send â€˜Good Newsâ€™ emails/notes home to studentsâ€™ families? Itâ€™s a great way to open up communication with parents/guardians at the start of the year. Iâ€™ve been doing this for the past few years and the feedback has been great. Parents have told me that itâ€™s lovely to hear good things about how their child is getting on and that it also takes away any concern that they might have that a teacher contacting home means something bad. Kids have come to school the next morning beaming with pride about their family reading the special message from Teacher too and how proud their grownups at home and school are of them. Itâ€™s a win win all round. Would definitely recommend adding this idea to your plan this September! ðŸ˜Š\n\n#teacheridea #teachertip #teacherparentcommunication #classroomideas #backtoschool #irishprimaryteacher #teachertalk #teachershare #myclassroom #teachersofinstagram #teachingisaworkofheart",
