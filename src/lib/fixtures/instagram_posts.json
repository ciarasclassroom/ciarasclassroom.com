Anti-racism education and celebrating diversity should weave into your teaching all year long. Check out my latest blogpost (ciarasclassroom.com/blog or click the link in my bio) for some ideas on how you can approach MLK Day meaningfully while building a foundation for continuous, inclusive learning.\n\n#mlkday #classroomideas #teacherblog #teacherblogger #teacherideas #iteachtoo #teachingisaworkofheart #inclusiveeducation #blacklivesmatter #muinteoir #diversitymatters #inclusiveclassroom #lessonplans #classroom #elementaryschool #teachergramüçé",

Today the kids worked in teams to create a poster to show different lengths, sort based on length and then label the shortest and longest piece. Very simple but great for encouraging maths talk and teamwork skills. Each group presented their ‚Äòproject‚Äô afterwards. \n\n#mathlesson #mathskills #seniorinfants #mathstalk #kidsproject #classroomideas #instateacher #teachergram #teacherideas #learningisfun #lessonplanning #irishprimaryteacher #earlyyears #teachersoninstagram",
