While I have loved being AP2 for Learn Together, school ethos, Student Council and wellbeing—areas I’m incredibly passionate about and love sharing here—I’m looking forward to this new challenge and the opportunity to dive deeper into STEM education.\n\nInclusive multicultural education is still an area I am passionate about so I’ll be continuing to share this type of content here on Instagram going forward, with maybe some sprinklings of Maths, Science and/or Technology on occasion. \n\nHere’s to new beginnings and exciting adventures ahead! 🌟\n\n#assistantprincipal #stemeducation #ap1 #leadershipandmanagement #schoolleadership #muinteoir #irishprimaryteacher #teachergram #instateacher #teachingisfun #newjobs #primaryschoolteacher #iteach #teacherfriends #teachershare #teachertalk #teachersfollowteachers #2025plans #newyearnewgoals #imateacher #teacherleader",

There are loads of read aloud videos of this story available online too so could be a nice one even while the children are eating their lunch. 🙂\n\n#hanukkah #inclusiveclassroom #readaloud #inclusiveeducation #picturebooks #learntogether #instateacher #iteachtoo #seniorinfants #muinteoir #elementaryschoolteacher #primaryschoolteacher #irishprimaryteacher #teacherblogger #teachingindecember #teachingisaworkofheart #teachergram🍎",

    "caption": "This month our theme in Senior Infants is ‘Celebrations’ . We are learning about celebrating in general (eg what different things might people celebrate, how might they celebrate, why might they celebrate? etc) , as well as come specific celebrations, including New Year, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas. Here’s a fine motor (cutting skills) activity linked to learning about Kwanzaa. During Kwanzaa people light seven candles on the kinara. One candle is lit each day as each candle corresponds to a day of Kwanzaa, and the special principle of that day. First, the black candle in the centre is lit. Then the rest continues from left to right, with the red candles next and the green candles after. The seven candles/principles of Kwanzaa are Unity, Self-determination, Collective Work and Responsibility, Cooperative Economics, Purpose, Creativity and Faith. \n\nThis activity is available on my TPT page. ❤️🖤💚\n\n#kwanzaa #tptstore #inclusiveeducation #multiculturalclassroom #teachersfollowingteachers #learntogether #instateacher #educatetogether #tptseller #myclassroom #cuttingskills #finemotoractivity #teachershare #teachersofinstagram #teachergram #decemberintheclassroom #seniorinfants #teachertalk #teachersofig",
