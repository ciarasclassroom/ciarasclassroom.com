    "caption": "This month our theme in Senior Infants is ‚ÄòCelebrations‚Äô . We are learning about celebrating in general (eg what different things might people celebrate, how might they celebrate, why might they celebrate? etc) , as well as come specific celebrations, including New Year, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah and Christmas. Here‚Äôs a fine motor (cutting skills) activity linked to learning about Kwanzaa. During Kwanzaa people light seven candles on the kinara. One candle is lit each day as each candle corresponds to a day of Kwanzaa, and the special principle of that day. First, the black candle in the centre is lit. Then the rest continues from left to right, with the red candles next and the green candles after. The seven candles/principles of Kwanzaa are Unity, Self-determination, Collective Work and Responsibility, Cooperative Economics, Purpose, Creativity and Faith. \n\nThis activity is available on my TPT page. ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö\n\n#kwanzaa #tptstore #inclusiveeducation #multiculturalclassroom #teachersfollowingteachers #learntogether #instateacher #educatetogether #tptseller #myclassroom #cuttingskills #finemotoractivity #teachershare #teachersofinstagram #teachergram #decemberintheclassroom #seniorinfants #teachertalk #teachersofig",
