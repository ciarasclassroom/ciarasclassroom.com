    "caption": "This book has proven to be an interesting read in terms of giving and receiving clear constructive feedback, particularly in relation to tricky conversations. One thing that I‚Äôve taken from it is that the ‚Äòsandwich method‚Äô is not always the most effective way to communicate feedback when change/improvement is needed. A little formula shared in the book is to plan your opening sentence for any potentially difficult conversations with ‚ÄúI + issue + outcome‚Äù. By including all three of these in the first sentence, it makes it clear from the beginning of the conversation that action is needed and focuses the conversation on being professional, productive, collaborative, supportive and effective. It also goes through a variety of verbal and non-verbal communication tips for during difficult conversations with both parents and colleagues. While the book is aimed more for the UK education system, I still feel that it included theory and practical tips that I can apply in my own work life. üôÇ\n\nHave you read any CPD books? Do you have any recommendations to share? ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n#teachercpd #teachertalk #teacherbookclub #teacherbooks #lifelonglearner #teachershare #teachingandlearning #instateacher #teachergram #teachersfollowingteachers",

It‚Äôs the perfect time to start meaningful conversations in your classroom about anti-racism and inclusion. \n\nBut let‚Äôs not stop at one day. Anti-racism education and celebrating diversity should weave into your teaching all year long.
