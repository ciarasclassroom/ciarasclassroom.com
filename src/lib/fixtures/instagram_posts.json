    "caption": "Looking for an interesting way to work on Maths Talk in a senior classroom? I rediscovered this book while having a look around @cogs_the_brain_shop during the summer. In Third Class a few years ago, my colleague introduced our team to this book and it was such a great addition to our maths resources. The book includes a variety of logic puzzles that involve lots of talk, reasoning, and problem solving. Definitely worth a look if you are trying to find some new inspiration for sparking maths talk in a senior class. You could even give them the puzzle to solve in pairs or groups to get even more maths talk going.
