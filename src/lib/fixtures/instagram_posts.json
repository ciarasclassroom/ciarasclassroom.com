The Learn Together curriculum in Educate Together schools does exactly that‚Äîit gives students the tools to see and appreciate the unique qualities in everyone around them, fostering a sense of belonging and respect.\n\nThrough Learn Together, children develop a strong foundation in values like fairness, equality, and compassion. They learn that their voices matter and that they can make a real difference, no matter how young they are. It‚Äôs amazing to see kids realise that they don‚Äôt have to wait until they‚Äôre adults to contribute positively to their communities‚Äîthey can start right here, right now.\n\nCheck out my new blog post at ciarasclassroom.com/blog to read the post in full and learn more about the Learn Together curriculum. \n\n#learntogether #muinteoir #ethicaleducation #newblogpost #teacherblogger #teacherblog #teachertalk #teachershare #irishprimaryteacher #irisheducation #teachergram",
