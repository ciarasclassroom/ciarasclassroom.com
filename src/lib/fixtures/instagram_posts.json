Each child gets their own sheet with a section of the image. After colouring in their pieces, each page gets stuck together to create the full display. The pack comes with 4-piece, 9-piece, 15-piece and 28-piece versions. 🖍️ Available now in my TPT store! 💛 #MLKDay #inclusiveclassroom #teachersofinstagram #ciarasclassroom #inclusiveeducation #teachertalk #martinlutherkingjr #classroomideas #teacherideas #teachergram #teachersofinstagram",

Here are some ideas inspired by ‘Kenny Lives with Erica and Martina’ by @popnollyuk . In my school, we have a full set of all picture books from Pop n Olly and I honestly think they are a brilliant addition to any school’s library! \n\n#lessonideas #inclusiveeducation #muinteoir #lessonplanning #teachershare #teachergram #teachersofinstagram #teachingisaworkofheart #lifelessons #globalcitizen #childrensrights #edutalk #learntogether",

    "caption": "Set up our new little Investigation Area for the next fortnight today. The focus is both turn taking and fine motor skills (both using the ice pick/hammer, plus putting all the pieces back together to play again). Bought this game online for only €1/€2 and it fits perfectly with our January theme of ‘Polar Exploration’. 🐧❄️ \n\nOur Investigation Area is open during morning arrival, playtime/Aistear, lunchtime (after they’ve finished their snack) and as an early finisher option.  The activities change regularly and vary between games and open ended tasks. They focus on different skills and/or subject areas each month. January is going to be social and fine motor skills. \n\n#classroomideas #myclassroom #playbasedlearning #polarexplorer #investigationarea #teacherideas #finemotorskills #socialskillsforkids #teachershare #elementaryteacher #irishprimaryteacher #primaryschool #iteachtoo #teachingisfun",
