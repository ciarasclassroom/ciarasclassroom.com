Would highly recommend to 3rd and 4th class teachers. üòÉ The competition involves your students designing solutions for a local community problem, which could be easily linked to so many subjects for integrated project based learning! There is also the opportunity to request an engineer visit to your classroom to inspire the children!

So much learning and the kids really enjoy it!\n\n‚ÄòAlphablocks‚Äô is a similar show based on phonics and is well worth checking out too. \n\nOr, if you are looking for a little bit of Gaeilge, ‚ÄòFia‚Äôs Fairies‚Äô on the RTEPlayer is another great option. \n\n#numberblocks #educationalvideos #numeracy #youtubeforkids #seniorinfants #infantteacher #teachershare #teacher #primaryschoolteacher #iteachtoo #classroomresources",
