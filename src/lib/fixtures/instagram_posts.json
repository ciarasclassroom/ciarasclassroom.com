While I have loved being AP2 for Learn Together, school ethos, Student Council and wellbeing—areas I’m incredibly passionate about and love sharing here—I’m looking forward to this new challenge and the opportunity to dive deeper into STEM education.\n\nInclusive multicultural education is still an area I am passionate about so I’ll be continuing to share this type of content here on Instagram going forward, with maybe some sprinklings of Maths, Science and/or Technology on occasion. \n\nHere’s to new beginnings and exciting adventures ahead! 🌟\n\n#assistantprincipal #stemeducation #ap1 #leadershipandmanagement #schoolleadership #muinteoir #irishprimaryteacher #teachergram #instateacher #teachingisfun #newjobs #primaryschoolteacher #iteach #teacherfriends #teachershare #teachertalk #teachersfollowteachers #2025plans #newyearnewgoals #imateacher #teacherleader",
