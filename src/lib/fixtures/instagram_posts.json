In Learn Together, it is used to explore religions and belief system. It moves beyond rote learning facts about a religion, encouraging learners to analyse, reflect and make connections between new ideas, their personal experiences and the wider world. Check out my latest blog post for some insights into this teaching methodology. \n\n#conceptualenquiry #teachingmethodology #lessonplanning #learntogether #teacherblogger #teacherblog #newblogpost #teacherssupportteachers #teachersfollowteachers #teachershare #teachertalk #muinteoir #teachingideas #primaryschoolteacher",

    "caption": "Some food for thought. Before the Winter Break I attended a few sessions at my local Women’s Circle as a form of mindfulness and wellbeing practice. The circle involves some breathing exercises, guided meditation, reflection time and opportunities to share thoughts and perspectives on various different topics/themes. It sometimes includes some journaling time based on a particular prompt too. At the end of the session each person picks a card and reads the message or affirmation on it. Thought I’d share mine here for anyone who might find the message meaningful. \n\n#hello2025 #foodforthought #shareyourgifts #instateacher #teacherfriends #imateacher #iteachtoo #irishprimaryteacher",
