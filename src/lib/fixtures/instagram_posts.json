Here are some ideas inspired by ‘Kenny Lives with Erica and Martina’ by @popnollyuk . In my school, we have a full set of all picture books from Pop n Olly and I honestly think they are a brilliant addition to any school’s library! \n\n#lessonideas #inclusiveeducation #muinteoir #lessonplanning #teachershare #teachergram #teachersofinstagram #teachingisaworkofheart #lifelessons #globalcitizen #childrensrights #edutalk #learntogether",

    "caption": "Set up our new little Investigation Area for the next fortnight today. The focus is both turn taking and fine motor skills (both using the ice pick/hammer, plus putting all the pieces back together to play again). Bought this game online for only €1/€2 and it fits perfectly with our January theme of ‘Polar Exploration’. 🐧❄️ \n\nOur Investigation Area is open during morning arrival, playtime/Aistear, lunchtime (after they’ve finished their snack) and as an early finisher option.  The activities change regularly and vary between games and open ended tasks. They focus on different skills and/or subject areas each month. January is going to be social and fine motor skills. \n\n#classroomideas #myclassroom #playbasedlearning #polarexplorer #investigationarea #teacherideas #finemotorskills #socialskillsforkids #teachershare #elementaryteacher #irishprimaryteacher #primaryschool #iteachtoo #teachingisfun",

    "caption": "The conceptual enquiry approach is a teaching methodology designed to help students to explore big concepts and questions. In Learn Together, it is used to explore religions and belief system. It moves beyond rote learning facts about a religion, encouraging learners to analyse, reflect and make connections between new ideas, their personal experiences and the wider world. Check out my latest blog post for some insights into this teaching methodology. \n\n#conceptualenquiry #teachingmethodology #lessonplanning #learntogether #teacherblogger #teacherblog #newblogpost #teacherssupportteachers #teachersfollowteachers #teachershare #teachertalk #muinteoir #teachingideas #primaryschoolteacher",
