    "caption": "Some food for thought. Before the Winter Break I attended a few sessions at my local Women’s Circle as a form of mindfulness and wellbeing practice. The circle involves some breathing exercises, guided meditation, reflection time and opportunities to share thoughts and perspectives on various different topics/themes. It sometimes includes some journaling time based on a particular prompt too. At the end of the session each person picks a card and reads the message or affirmation on it. Thought I’d share mine here for anyone who might find the message meaningful. \n\n#hello2025 #foodforthought #shareyourgifts #instateacher #teacherfriends #imateacher #iteachtoo #irishprimaryteacher",

While I have loved being AP2 for Learn Together, school ethos, Student Council and wellbeing—areas I’m incredibly passionate about and love sharing here—I’m looking forward to this new challenge and the opportunity to dive deeper into STEM education.\n\nInclusive multicultural education is still an area I am passionate about so I’ll be continuing to share this type of content here on Instagram going forward, with maybe some sprinklings of Maths, Science and/or Technology on occasion. \n\nHere’s to new beginnings and exciting adventures ahead! 🌟\n\n#assistantprincipal #stemeducation #ap1 #leadershipandmanagement #schoolleadership #muinteoir #irishprimaryteacher #teachergram #instateacher #teachingisfun #newjobs #primaryschoolteacher #iteach #teacherfriends #teachershare #teachertalk #teachersfollowteachers #2025plans #newyearnewgoals #imateacher #teacherleader",
