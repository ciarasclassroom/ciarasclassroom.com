    "caption": "The arts have a unique ability to bring people together, spark creativity, and foster understanding.  Here are some engaging and respectful ideas for incorporating cultural diversity through the arts in your classroom:\n\n1. Study Diverse Artists: Introduce your students to artists like Alma Thomas (African-American), Katsushika Hokusai (Japanese), Frida Kahlo (Mexico), El Anatsui (Ghana), or Pauline Bewick (Irish). Use their work as inspiration for your students‚Äô own creations.\n\n2. World Music Listening Sessions: Play music from different countries, such as West African drumming, Indian classical music, or Irish traditional tunes. Discuss the instruments and rhythms used, and how music reflects cultural identity.\n\n3. Exploring Folktales Through Performance: Share folktales or legends from different cultures, such as Anansi the Spider (West Africa/Carribean), The Legend of the Rainbow Serpent (Indigenous Australian), The Bremen Town Musicians (Germany), or The Children of Lir (Ireland). Students can create simple performances that focus on the emotions or lessons within these stories.\n\n4. Cultural Dance Videos: Show videos of traditional performances, like c√©il√≠ dancing, Maori haka, samba, gumboot dance. Use these as starting points for discussions about culture and identity.\n\nFor more ideas for exploring the arts through a diverse lens, head over to ciarasclassroom.com/blog üòÉ\n\nDon‚Äôt forget to like and save for later!\n\n#teacherblog #teacherblogger #muinteoir #teacherfriends #diversitymatters #inclusiveeducation #classroomideas #instateacher #teachingisaworkofheart #imateacher #primaryschoolteacher #teacherideas #lessonplans #lessonplanning",

    "caption": "This book has proven to be an interesting read in terms of giving and receiving clear constructive feedback, particularly in relation to tricky conversations. One thing that I‚Äôve taken from it is that the ‚Äòsandwich method‚Äô is not always the most effective way to communicate feedback when change/improvement is needed. A little formula shared in the book is to plan your opening sentence for any potentially difficult conversations with ‚ÄúI + issue + outcome‚Äù. By including all three of these in the first sentence, it makes it clear from the beginning of the conversation that action is needed and focuses the conversation on being professional, productive, collaborative, supportive and effective. It also goes through a variety of verbal and non-verbal communication tips for during difficult conversations with both parents and colleagues. While the book is aimed more for the UK education system, I still feel that it included theory and practical tips that I can apply in my own work life. üôÇ\n\nHave you read any CPD books? Do you have any recommendations to share? ‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n#teachercpd #teachertalk #teacherbookclub #teacherbooks #lifelonglearner #teachershare #teachingandlearning #instateacher #teachergram #teachersfollowingteachers",
