It‚Äôs the perfect time to start meaningful conversations in your classroom about anti-racism and inclusion. \n\nBut let‚Äôs not stop at one day. Anti-racism education and celebrating diversity should weave into your teaching all year long. Check out my latest blogpost (ciarasclassroom.com/blog or click the link in my bio) for some ideas on how you can approach MLK Day meaningfully while building a foundation for continuous, inclusive learning.\n\n#mlkday #classroomideas #teacherblog #teacherblogger #teacherideas #iteachtoo #teachingisaworkofheart #inclusiveeducation #blacklivesmatter #muinteoir #diversitymatters #inclusiveclassroom #lessonplans #classroom #elementaryschool #teachergramüçé",

Today the kids worked in teams to create a poster to show different lengths, sort based on length and then label the shortest and longest piece. Very simple but great for encouraging maths talk and teamwork skills. Each group presented their ‚Äòproject‚Äô afterwards. \n\n#mathlesson #mathskills #seniorinfants #mathstalk #kidsproject #classroomideas #instateacher #teachergram #teacherideas #learningisfun #lessonplanning #irishprimaryteacher #earlyyears #teachersoninstagram",

Each child gets their own sheet with a section of the image. After colouring in their pieces, each page gets stuck together to create the full display. The pack comes with 4-piece, 9-piece, 15-piece and 28-piece versions. üñçÔ∏è Available now in my TPT store! üíõ #MLKDay #inclusiveclassroom #teachersofinstagram #ciarasclassroom #inclusiveeducation #teachertalk #martinlutherkingjr #classroomideas #teacherideas #teachergram #teachersofinstagram",
