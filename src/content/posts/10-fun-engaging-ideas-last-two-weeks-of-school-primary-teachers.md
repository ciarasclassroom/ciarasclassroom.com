You’re nearly there! The books are almost closed, the weather’s warming up (hopefully), and attention spans are starting to fade. But the last couple of weeks can still be some of the most memorable and joyful parts of the year. This post shares 10 teacher-loved activities that help you wrap up the term with fun, connection, and just a little bit of learning too.

1. The Countdown to Summer Jar
   Write fun, silly or meaningful prompts on slips of paper. Each day, pull one out and complete the activity as a class. From “desk swap day” to “write a compliment note for someone,” this is a class favourite!

2. Memory Sharing Circles
   Sit in a circle and share favourite memories from the year. You can make it themed (funniest moment, proudest moment, best book we read, etc.) or totally open-ended.
3. Class Awards Ceremony
   Host a light-hearted, classroom awards ceremony with categories like ‘Best Laugh’ or ‘Most Likely to be a Future Artist.’ Not only does this let kids feel appreciated, but it also gives you a chance to celebrate their unique qualities and hard work. If you’re looking for a simple way to print out certificates for this, check out my Graduation Certificates for some inspiration!

4. Free Writing Fiesta
   Give kids free choice writing time – comic strips, summer stories, “Dear Me in 6 Months” letters… Add music and snacks for chilled-out vibes.
5. Year in Review Mini-Documentary
   Split into small groups and record short clips of “interviews,” skits or reenactments of moments from the year. Compile into a class video (or just watch them back raw for laughs!).
6. Summer-Themed STEM Challenge
   Build the best paper umbrella, design a water balloon launcher, or create a floating boat from recyclables. Lots of fun with a sneaky bit of science thrown in!
7. “Footsteps Through Our Year” Interactive Display   \
   Have each child trace their shoe onto card and decorate it with symbols or drawings that represent their highlights from the year — favourite subjects, friends, funny moments. String them together in a path that winds through the classroom or school corridor, showing the journey you’ve taken together.
8. End-of-Year Escape Room (DIY Style)   \
   If you’re looking for something different, an escape room challenge could be an exciting way to end the year! Create puzzles and clues related to subjects the students have learned throughout the year. Working together to solve the challenges fosters teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking while adding a touch of adventure to the last days of school. — e.g. a Gaeilge clue, a maths riddle, a memory clue from a book you read. Split into teams and let them work together to solve their way to “summer break.”  Bonus: include a final “treasure” like your Graduation Certificates — \[insert your product link here]
9. Invent-a-Game Day   \
   Challenge your class to invent their own playground or board game in small groups. They’ll need to design the rules, draw a diagram or board, and come up with how someone “wins.” Then let them teach their game to another group and play! It’s a brilliant mix of creativity, collaboration, oral language, and critical thinking — and the kids barely realise they’re learning.
10. Story Dice Theatre: Creative Drama Fun   \
    Story Dice Theatre is a fantastic way to combine imagination with drama in the classroom. Using story dice (which you can easily make or buy), children roll the dice to reveal random words, images, or themes. In pairs or small groups, they then create a short skit or performance based on the prompts. This activity encourages teamwork, oral language skills, and creativity — but it feels like pure fun! You can give the kids the freedom to use costumes, props, and even act out their story for the class. It’s an engaging way to revisit storytelling techniques, narrative structure, and public speaking skills, all while keeping the atmosphere light and joyful as the school year winds down.
11. Outdoor Games and Challenges
    Take advantage of the nice weather by having an outdoor day full of fun challenges. From a class relay race to tug-of-war, these classic games are a great way to wrap up the school year while encouraging teamwork and physical activity.
12. Create a Time Capsule
    Have the class create a time capsule to be opened the next year. Let them include items that represent the things they loved about this year: photos, drawings, a letter to their future selves, or a list of their favourite things. This is a great way to reflect on what the class has achieved and look ahead to the future.

However you spend the final stretch, remember: your class won’t remember every page of every book — but they will remember the laughs, the kindness, and the magic of their last weeks with you. You’ve nearly made it — finish strong, and finish with joy!
