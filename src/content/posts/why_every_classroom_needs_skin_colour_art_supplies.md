Let's chat about something that might seem small but can make a huge difference in your classroom: skin tone crayons, pencils and paints. Stick with me, and I'll show you why these little tools are secretly superstars in creating an inclusive, respectful, and vibrant learning space…

In September 2014, I was teaching a self portraits art lesson in my Third Class classroom.  After finishing the drawing stage of the lesson, I was walking around the room as the children coloured in their portraits and something caught my eye; one child was colouring their face in their self portrait with a blue crayon.  I complimented their beautiful artwork and curiously asked about their colour choice. The child's response struck me. They explained that the 'skin colour' crayon (pointing at the peach one in their pencil case) didn't look like them and they had come to the conclusion that their blue crayon was a closer match.  This moment and conversation will always stick with me. Every September since then, I'm reminded of that blue self-portrait. It inspires me to refresh our classroom's collection of skin tone art supplies, ensuring every child can find a color that truly reflects who they are.

#### Why It's More Than Just Art

1. "I See Me!": When kids can represent themselves accurately in art, it's like a little self-esteem boost in crayon form.
2. "I See You!": Using different skin tones helps kids naturally appreciate the diversity around them. It's anti-racism in action, without a lecture in sight!
3. "Let's Talk": Ever noticed how art gets kids chatting? With diverse skin tones, those chats organically turn to culture, identity, and respect. Learning through colouring – how cool is that?
4. "Everyone's Beautiful": By ditching the old 'one-size-fits-all' skin tone, we're showing kids that beauty comes in all shades.
5. "I Can Mix That!": Mixing colours to get the perfect skin tone? That's science, art, and cultural appreciation rolled into one fun activity!

#### Making it Happen in Your Classroom

* Front and Centre: Put those skin tone supplies where everyone can see and reach them easily.
* Mix It Up: Encourage kids to experiment with mixing colours to create unique skin tones.
* Model it Yourself: Use diverse skin tones in your own classroom artwork and decorations.


So, what do you say? Ready to add some skin tone colours to your classroom? Trust me, once you see the impact, you'll wonder how you ever taught without them. It's more than art – it's a step towards a more inclusive, respectful, and vibrant world. And it all starts with a simple crayon.
