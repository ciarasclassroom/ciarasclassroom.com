Hi there! A big thank you to Ciara for inviting me to share my story on her blog. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m David and I run a teacher Instagram account called Múinteoir Dave. I started my account three years ago after finishing the PME as a way to document my teaching journey. Another thing about me? I’m colourblind.

### What is Colourblindness?

Colourblindness, or more accurately, colour vision deficiency, is a hidden disability affecting how a person perceives colours. It’s a genetic condition, usually passed down through the X chromosome, caused by an irregular development of colour-detecting cells, known as cones, in the back of the eye. There are three types of cones in the human eye, each responsible for detecting blue, green, or red light. When one or more of these cones don’t develop properly, the brain receives incomplete signals, making it difficult to distinguish certain colours.

There are several types of colourblindness, but the most common include:

* Deuteranomaly (red/green deficiency due to inability to perceive green light)
* Protanomaly (reds and greens looking more muted due to inability to perceive red light)
* Tritanopia (blue/yellow deficiency due to inability to perceive blue light)

In my case, I experience a combination of these. Imagine looking at a paint pallet booklet with hues getting darker as you go down the column. I can differentiate the first and third colours in the column but I cannot differentiate the first and second colours or the second and third colours. For me, when colours of similar hues are in close proximity, they will begin to bleed into each other while I look at them and then the undertones of the colours will begin to become more prominent in a cyclical way which results in the object I'm looking at to constantly change colours and make it impossible for me to identify it's true colour. For example, if I look at a blue plastic chair in a classroom, any dark marks or specs of dirt on the seat can bleed into the blue, making the chair appear to continually shift between blue, purple, grey, and green, over and over again until I look away. This constant colour distortion is how I see the world every day.

Colourblindness is more common than you might think. Around 300 million people worldwide are colourblind, with 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females affected. In an average urban school, this means that in each class there may be two or three colourblind boys and there may be one or two colourblind girls in the school.

### My Story

I was diagnosed with colourblindness at age seven, thanks to my First Class teacher, Mrs. Scully. During a maths lesson where we were doing a colour-by-number activity, she noticed that my tree had a bright red trunk and brown leaves, unlike the other kids' pictures. When she asked me to describe my process, she realised I was getting the sums correct but choosing the wrong colours from the crayon tub. After a conversation with my mom and a visit to an ophthalmologist, I was diagnosed with colourblindness.

Colourblindness impacts more than just my ability to see colours. Simple tasks like picking matching clothes, cooking (since I can’t tell when food like meat is fully cooked), and even driving at night can be challenging. One particularly bad experience came when I gave myself severe food poisoning from undercooking chicken, leading to early stages of organ failure. I couldn't tell the food was undercooked because my eyes couldn’t perceive the change in colour.

### Tips for Supporting Colourblindness in the Classroom

1\. Avoid Over-Reliance on Colour-Coding
Many teaching strategies rely on colour-coding to differentiate concepts. For example, using red and orange counters to teach phonics or rhyme might make sense to most students, but to someone who is colourblind, these counters may appear identical. A better approach is to use shapes or patterns along with colours to make these visual cues more accessible. Labeling items with words, such as on classroom displays or group designations, can also help.

2\. Use Clear Labels for School Spaces
In my school, colour-coded stairwells are labeled with word signs to ensure both students and staff can easily navigate the building, regardless of their ability to perceive colours. Likewise, our school calendars have been adjusted to make colour coding more distinguishable.

3\. Reduce Visual Overload
Colourblind people can become visually overstimulated in bright, multicoloured classrooms. To make the learning environment more comfortable, try using a cohesive colour scheme. In my classroom, I use light blue as my main colour for backing displays, paired with a complementary border. This creates a calming atmosphere that helps everyone focus.

4\. Educate Students About Colourblindness
Children often think colourblindness means you "can’t see any colours," but it’s far more complex. Books like Erik the Red Sees Green by Julie Anderson are excellent tools to help children understand the condition. I read this book with every class I teach, and it helps them understand not only my experience but also their own, should they be colourblind and undiagnosed.

If you’ve made it this far, I hope my story has given you some insight into one of the most common hidden disabilities and how we can better support colourblind students and colleagues in our classrooms. A small change in how we organise and teach can have a lasting impact. My teacher, Mrs. Scully, changed my life by recognising my colourblindness. Let’s all be the Mrs. Scully in our classrooms, ensuring every student gets the support they need to succeed.
