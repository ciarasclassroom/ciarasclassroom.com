description: >-
  Colourblindness, or more accurately, colour vision deficiency, is a hidden
  disability affecting how a person perceives colours. It’s a genetic condition,
  usually passed down through the X chromosome, caused by an irregular
  development of colour-detecting cells in the eye, known as cones.  In this
  guest post, Múinteoir Dave (a colourblind teacher) shares insights and top
  tips.
