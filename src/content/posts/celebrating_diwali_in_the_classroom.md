Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a special celebration in Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism.  This five-day festival usually falls between October and November, with the main celebration on the third day. This year, Diwali will be celebrated on Friday the 1st of November 2024.  At its heart, Diwali symbolises the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.

In Hinduism, Diwali often commemorates Prince Rama's return to Ayodhya with his wife Sita, after defeating the demon king Ravana. People lit oil lamps to guide them home, which is why lights are so central to the celebration.

To the Jains, Diwali is the day that Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara, attained nirvana.  This is a key event in Jainism, and Diwali is a time for spiritual reflection, fasting, and charity. Jain temples are often illuminated with lights, and Jains also engage in prayers and rituals to honour Mahavira’s teachings.

For Sikh people, Diwali coincides with Bandi Chhor Divas, celebrating the release of Guru Hargobind Ji from imprisonment. The Golden Temple was illuminated to welcome the Guru, establishing another connection to the festival of lights.

Across Hinduism, Sikhism, and Jainism, the tradition of lighting diyas (small clay lamps) is central, filling homes and temples with a warm, glowing light that symbolises hope, enlightenment, and the triumph of good over evil.

Celebrating Diwali in the classroom is a wonderful way to introduce students to the rich cultural traditions and values associated with this multi-faith festival. Here are 10 simple and engaging activities that you can use to mark Diwali in your classroom:

### 1. Art Activity: Rangoli Patterns

Rangoli is a traditional art form where patterns are drawn on the ground using coloured powders, rice, or flower petals. In class, students could create their own rangoli designs on paper using bright-coloured markers, crayons, crepe paper or even small beads. For younger students, you could provide pre-drawn templates of simple patterns. Older students could challenge themselves by designing their own intricate patterns. This activity could tie also into a broader lesson on symmetry, angles, or patterns, showing students how maths can be found in traditional art forms.

### 2. Story Time: Picture Book - “The Best Diwali Ever”

Read “The Best Diwali Ever” by Sonali Shaha heartwarming story that beautifully captures the excitement and joy of Diwali from a child’s perspective. The book follows a young girl named Ariana, who is eager to celebrate Diwali with her family. However, not everything goes according to plan, and she learns that Diwali is not just about the decorations and sweets, but about love, family, and togetherness. After reading the story, engage the class in a discussion about the themes of family, perseverance, and finding joy in unexpected moments. You could follow this up by asking students to share what family traditions are most special to them, or even write a short story about their own celebration of Diwali (or another festival). This activity encourages literacy, empathy, and reflection on the deeper meaning of festivals.

### 3. Diwali Traditions Around the World

Help students explore how Diwali is celebrated in different parts of the world, from India to the UK, Canada, and beyond. Create a "Diwali Around the World" poster or slideshow as a class project. Each student or small group can be assigned a country or region to research. This activity enhances research skills and broadens their understanding of how festivals evolve in different cultural settings.

### 4. Collaborative Diwali Colouring Project

Use a [collaborative Diwali colouring project](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diwali-Collaborative-Art-Coloring-Project-12350575?st=8c96cf8840b170db84eb8c02aca3f937\&utm_source=My%20Blog\&utm_campaign=Diwali%20Blog%20Post) to create a beautiful Diwali-themed artwork that can be displayed in the classroom or hallway. Each student gets a portion of the overall image to colour, and when all the pieces are combined, it reveals the full image. This is a fun way to build classroom community while celebrating the festival. With easy-to-follow instructions and printable templates (8, 16, 18, 25, 32 and 36 sheet versions included), it's a no-stress addition to your classroom that is perfect for marking this special festival with your students.

### 5. Diwali STEM Challenge: Build a Floating Diya

Diwali is famous for its diyas—small oil lamps made from clay. Challenge your students to design and construct a floating diya.  The students could use a variety of materials like cork, aluminum foil, play dough, or small cups. You could even give each team a small tealight (unlit or battery operated) to fit inside their design.  The goal is to create a diya that will float on water for the longest time.  This activity encourages teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity, making it an exciting way to incorporate Diwali into a STEM lesson.

### 6. Classroom Visitor: Invite a Parent or Community Member to Share Diwali Traditions

If possible, invite a parent or local community member who celebrates Diwali to come in and share their personal experiences and traditions. They could talk about how their family prepares for Diwali, what they eat, how they decorate their home, and more. This brings the celebration to life and gives students an opportunity to ask questions and deepen their understanding of the holiday.

### 7. Diwali Greeting Cards 

Here are some [Diwali Greeting Card Templates](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Diwali-Card-Templates-8866707?utm_source=My%20Blog\&utm_campaign=Diwali%20Blog%20Post) that your students could use to colour and write their own Diwali cards to send to family or classmates.  As a class, you could also discuss how sending cards during Diwali is a way of sharing good wishes, just as we might exchange cards for other holidays.

### 9. Diwali Senses Exploration

Engage the senses by introducing the class to different scents, sounds, and textures that may be associated with Diwali. Bring in items such as incense, traditional Indian music, and different materials like silk, spices, or flowers (often used for garlands). Have the students describe how each item makes them feel, and talk about how Diwali appeals to all the senses, from the scent of the floral garlands to the sound of fireworks.

### 10. Class Diwali Feast

Introduce your students to the variety of foods traditionally enjoyed during Diwali. If feasible, organise a small Diwali food-tasting event with traditional snacks like samosas, ladoos, or other festive treats. Alternatively, have students research different Diwali foods and create a virtual feast, where they can share images, recipes, or drawings of their chosen dishes. This helps students appreciate the diversity of Diwali celebrations through food.

Celebrating Diwali in the classroom is a fantastic opportunity to embrace the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and traditions that enrich our world. By introducing children to the stories, symbols, and values of Diwali—whether through art, stories, STEM activities, or community connections—we not only help them gain a deeper understanding of this vibrant festival but also foster a sense of inclusion and respect for different cultures. These activities can spark curiosity, encourage empathy, and inspire creativity in every student, making your classroom a place where all traditions are honoured and celebrated.
