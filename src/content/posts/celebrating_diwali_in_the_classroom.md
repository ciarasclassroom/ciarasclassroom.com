  Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a special celebration in
  Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism.  This five-day festival usually falls between
  October and November, with the main celebration on the third day. This year,
  Diwali will be celebrated on Friday the 1st of November 2024.  At its heart,
  Diwali symbolises the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and
  knowledge over ignorance.


  In Hinduism, Diwali often commemorates Prince Rama's return to Ayodhya with
  his wife Sita, after defeating the demon king Ravana. People lit oil lamps to
  guide Rama home, which is why lights are so central to the celebration.


  To the Jains, Diwali is the day that Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara,
  attained nirvana.  This is a key event in Jainism, and Diwali is a time for
  spiritual reflection, fasting, and charity. Jain temples are often illuminated
  with lights, and Jains also engage in prayers and rituals to honour Mahavira’s
  teachings.


  For Sikh people, Diwali coincides with Bandi Chhor Divas, celebrating the
  release of Guru Hargobind Ji from imprisonment. The Golden Temple was
  illuminated to welcome the Guru, establishing another connection to the
  festival of lights.


  Across Hinduism, Sikhism, and Jainism, the tradition of lighting diyas (small
  clay lamps) is central, filling homes and temples with a warm, glowing light
  that symbolises hope, enlightenment, and the triumph of good over evil.

  Celebrating Diwali in the classroom is a wonderful way to introduce students
  to the rich cultural traditions and values associated with this multi-faith
  festival. Here are 10 creative, engaging activities that you can use to mark
  Diwali in your classroom:


  ### 1. Art Activity: Rangoli Patterns


  Rangoli is a traditional art form where patterns are drawn on the ground using
  coloured powders, rice, or flower petals. In class, students could create
  their own rangoli designs on paper using bright-colored markers, crayons,
  crepe paper or even small beads. For younger students, you could provide
  pre-drawn templates of simple patterns. Older students could challenge
  themselves by designing their own intricate patterns. This activity promotes
  creativity while introducing students to a beautiful Diwali tradition.

  ### 2. Story Time: Picture Book - “The Best Diwali Ever”


  Read “The Best Diwali Ever” by Sonali Shaha heartwarming story that
  beautifully captures the excitement and joy of Diwali from a child’s
  perspective. The book follows a young girl named Ariana, who is eager to
  celebrate Diwali with her family. However, not everything goes according to
  plan, and she learns that Diwali is not just about the decorations and sweets,
  but about love, family, and togetherness. After reading the story, engage the
  class in a discussion about the themes of family, perseverance, and finding
  joy in unexpected moments. You could follow this up by asking students to
  share what family traditions are most special to them, or even write a short
  story about their own celebration of Diwali (or another festival). This
  activity encourages literacy, empathy, and reflection on the deeper meaning of
  festivals.

  ### 4. Diwali STEM Challenge: Build a Floating Diya


  Diwali is famous for its diyas—small oil lamps made from clay. Challenge your
  students to design and construct a floating diya.  The students could use a
  variety of materials like cork, aluminum foil, play dough, or small cups. You
  could even give each team a small tealight (unlit or battery operated) to fit
  inside their design.  The goal is to create a diya that will float on water
  for the longest time.  This activity encourages teamwork, problem-solving, and
  creativity, making it an exciting way to incorporate Diwali into a STEM
  lesson.
