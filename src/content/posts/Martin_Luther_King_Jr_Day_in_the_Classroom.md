Martin Luther King Jr. Day, observed on the third Monday of January each year (January 20th in 2025), is a powerful opportunity to reflect on the values of equality, justice, and non-violence.  It’s the perfect time to start meaningful conversations in your classroom about anti-racism and inclusion. 

But let’s not stop at one day. Anti-racism education and celebrating diversity should weave into your teaching all year long. Here’s some ideas on how you can approach MLK Day meaningfully while building a foundation for continuous, inclusive learning.

### Tips and Activities to Bring MLK Day to Life

To make MLK Day meaningful, integrate these tips and activities into your lessons:

#### 1. Create a Classroom Pledge for Kindness and Justice

Start by exploring the values Dr. King stood for—courage, fairness, and non-violence.

* Activity: Brainstorm actions students can take to make their classroom a kinder, more inclusive place. Compile their ideas into a pledge, and have students sign or decorate it as a display of their commitment.

#### 2. Broaden the Story Beyond “I Have a Dream”

While Dr. King’s iconic speech is a great starting point, explore other aspects of his work, like the Montgomery Bus Boycott or the Poor People’s Campaign.

* Activity: Use graphic organisers to research and record information about different moments in Dr. King’s life. Students can brainstorm how these events connect to values like courage or resilience.

#### 3. Relate the Past to the Present

Help students connect historical struggles to modern-day issues of equity and justice.

* Activity: Have students write or draw about what they would work to change in today’s world if they were activists. Display their ideas as part of a “Change Makers Wall.”

#### 4.  Explore MLK's Speeches Through Music

Dr. King and other civil rights activists have inspired countless songs and musical works.

* Activity: Play songs like ‘Glory’ by John Legend and Common, ‘Oh Freedom!’, ‘We Shall Not Be Moved’ or ‘We Shall Overcome’. Discuss how music was a tool for unity and protest during the Civil Rights Movement and encourage students to create their own short songs or raps about courage, kindness, understanding, togetherness and/or equality.

#### 5. Teach Peaceful Problem-Solving

Dr. King’s commitment to non-violence is a timeless lesson in conflict resolution.

* Activity: Role-play scenarios where students practice peaceful solutions to common school conflicts, such as disagreements over sharing or teamwork.

#### 6. Engage with Art and Poetry

Dr. King’s messages of hope and unity lend themselves beautifully to creative expression.

* Activity: Guide students in writing peace-themed poems or creating collaborative art projects inspired by his legacy.

#### 7. Use Literature to Spark Conversations

Picture books and biographies are a great way to introduce Dr. King’s story.

* Activity: Read aloud ‘Martin’s Big Words’ by Doreen Rappaport or ‘A Sweet Smell of Roses’ by Angela Johnson. Ask students to reflect on how these stories make them feel and what they’ve learned.

#### 8. Dr. King’s Legacy in Action

Show students how Dr. King’s work has inspired modern activists and movements for justice.

* Activity: Watch a short, age-appropriate video about a recent social justice movement or leader. Ask students to discuss connections between Dr. King’s values and present-day efforts for equality.

### Building Anti-Racism Education Beyond MLK Day

Martin Luther King Jr. Day is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to fostering an inclusive classroom. Here are ways to ensure anti-racism education continues year-round:

#### 1. Celebrate Black Excellence All Year

Make a conscious effort to highlight the achievements, contributions, and stories of Black individuals throughout the curriculum—not just during Black History Month.

* In History: Share stories about changemakers like Harriet Tubman, Katherine Johnson, and Nelson Mandela.
* In Science: Introduce students to figures like Dr. Mae Jemison, the first Black female astronaut, or George Washington Carver, a pioneer in agriculture.
* In Literature: Incorporate books by Black authors or stories with Black protagonists, such as 'Hair Love' by Matthew Cherry or 'The Undefeated' by Kwame Alexander.

By embedding these narratives into your teaching, students see Black excellence as part of everyday learning rather than as an occasional highlight.

#### 2. Create Space for Honest Conversations

Encourage open and age-appropriate discussions about race, identity, and fairness. Children are naturally curious, and creating a safe space to explore these topics helps them develop empathy and understanding.

* Activity: Use children’s books as conversation starters. For example, read Let’s Talk About Race by Julius Lester or Something Happened in Our Town by Marianne Celano to spark meaningful discussions about equity and justice.

Remind students that it’s okay to ask questions and make mistakes as long as they’re learning and growing.

#### 3. Incorporate Anti-Racism into Everyday Lessons

Look for opportunities to integrate anti-racist perspectives into your teaching, no matter the subject.

* Maths: Explore the work of Black mathematicians like Katherine Johnson, whose calculations were crucial for NASA’s Apollo missions.
* Art: Study the vibrant works of Jacob Lawrence or explore the Harlem Renaissance through music and art projects.
* Science: Teach about groundbreaking Black scientists and inventors who have shaped our world.

By showing how Black history and culture intersect with every subject, you help students see that diversity is a strength woven into all aspects of life.

#### 4. Foster Critical Thinking About Bias and Stereotypes

Help students develop the skills to recognise and challenge stereotypes in media, books, and everyday life.

* Activity: Show students images, ads, or short videos and discuss whether they promote or challenge stereotypes.
* Discussion: Ask questions like, “Whose voices are missing?” or “What could be done differently to include more perspectives?”

Teaching students to identify and question bias equips them to navigate the world with greater awareness and empathy.

#### 5.  Empower Students to Be Changemakers

Encourage your students to take small, meaningful actions in their own communities.

* Activity: Brainstorm ways they can promote kindness and fairness, such as speaking up against unfair treatment, welcoming new classmates, or creating posters about inclusion.
* Extension: Share real-life examples of young activists, like Marley Dias, who created the #1000BlackGirlBooks campaign, or Xavier Logan, a teen advocating for educational equity.

Show them that everyone—regardless of age—can make a positive difference in the world.

#### 6. Diversify Your Classroom Resources

Representation matters. Make sure your classroom materials reflect the rich diversity of the world.

* Books: Add titles that celebrate Black voices, such as *‘All Are Welcome’* by Alexandra Penfold or ‘*Stamped (For Kids)’* by Jason Reynolds and Ibram X. Kendi.
* Posters and Displays: Use visuals that represent a range of cultures, identities, and historical figures.
* Media: Share music, [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/KidsBlackHistory/featured), or podcasts that celebrate Black culture and history. Explore jazz from the Harlem Renaissance, Motown hits, or music from countries and cultures all around the world.

Representation in the classroom helps all students feel seen, respected, and valued.
