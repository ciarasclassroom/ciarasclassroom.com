### What Is the Conceptual Enquiry Approach?

The Conceptual Enquiry Approach is a step-by-step methodology designed to help students explore big questions about belief systems. It moves beyond rote learning of facts, encouraging learners to analyse, reflect, and make connections between new ideas, their personal experiences, and the wider world.

This approach is particularly useful for teaching the Belief Systems strand of the Learn Together Curriculum, where the goal is to nurture an inclusive and respectful understanding of diverse worldviews.

### The 5 Steps of the Conceptual Enquiry Approach

Here’s how the Conceptual Enquiry Approach works step by step:

1. **Communicate**
   Students begin by sharing their initial thoughts and questions about the topic. For example, if they’re exploring the concept of "celebration," they might discuss holidays or special occasions they already know about. This step encourages open dialogue, curiosity and sets the tone for meaningful enquiry.
2. **Apply**
   Help students connect the concept to their own experiences or prior learning. They might reflect on celebrations in their lives, such as birthdays or school events, and consider their purpose and significance. This step bridges abstract ideas with familiar, relatable contexts.
3. **Enquire**
   This is where the real investigation begins. Students investigate the concept through research and questioning. For example, they could explore celebrations in Hinduism, Islam, or Judaism, discovering how different communities mark important events. This builds critical thinking and broadens their understanding.
4. **Contextualise**
   Students then place the concept in a broader cultural or historical framework. For instance, they could examine how celebrations like Diwali, Eid, or Hanukkah have evolved over time and their significance within different belief systems. This step fosters a deeper appreciation for diversity.
5. **Evaluate**
   Finally, students reflect on their learning. They consider how their understanding has changed, what insights they’ve gained, and what values or questions they want to explore further. This step solidifies personal growth and critical thinking.

### Why Use the Conceptual Enquiry Approach?

The Conceptual Enquiry Approach is about much more than teaching facts—it’s about creating a learning environment where students:

* Think critically about beliefs and values.
* Appreciate diversity in world religions and worldviews.
* Connect learning to their own lives and experiences.

By fostering thoughtful discussions and promoting inclusivity, this methodology helps students engage deeply with complex topics, equipping them with skills to respectfully navigate a diverse world.
