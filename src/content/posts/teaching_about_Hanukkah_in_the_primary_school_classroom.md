December is a month of light, wonder, and celebration in classrooms around the world. One tradition that beautifully embodies these values is Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights. Whether you’re looking to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for your students or introduce them to a new cultural celebration, this guide has you covered.

### What is Hanukkah? A Quick Teacher Overview

Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish celebration that honours the miracle of light and the resilience of the Jewish people. While it’s not one of the most religiously significant Jewish holidays, it holds a special place in Jewish culture and is widely celebrated around the world.

The Story Behind Hanukkah
Hanukkah commemorates events that took place over 2,000 years ago. In 165 BCE, the Maccabees, a small group of Jewish warriors, rose up against the oppressive Seleucid Empire to reclaim their Holy Temple in Jerusalem. When they regained control of the temple, they found only a small amount of sacred oil—enough to light the temple’s menorah (a candelabra) for one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for eight days, which allowed time for more oil to be prepared. This incredible event is the foundation of Hanukkah and is seen as a symbol of hope, perseverance, and faith.

Key Hanukkah Traditions

* Lighting the Menorah: Each night of Hanukkah, families light one additional candle on a nine-branched menorah (also called a hanukkiah). The ninth candle, known as the shamash (helper candle), is used to light the others. By the eighth night, all the candles are glowing, representing growing light and hope.

* Playing Dreidel: A dreidel is a four-sided spinning top with Hebrew letters representing the phrase "A great miracle happened there." Children play a game with the dreidel using chocolate coins (gelt) or small treats.

* Food Traditions: Foods fried in oil, such as potato pancakes (latkes) and jelly-filled doughnuts (sufganiyot), are enjoyed to honour the miracle of the oil.

* Gifts and Community: While not traditionally a gift-giving holiday, many Jewish families exchange small presents, particularly in regions where Christmas gift-giving is prominent. Hanukkah is also a time for coming together to celebrate with family, friends, and community.

#### Why Teach Hanukkah in Your Classroom?

Teaching about Hanukkah provides an opportunity to foster inclusivity and respect for diverse cultural traditions. It helps students learn about Jewish heritage while promoting values like resilience, hope, and the importance of light in times of darkness. Incorporating lessons about Hanukkah can also create a welcoming environment for Jewish students who celebrate this holiday.

By exploring the history and traditions of Hanukkah with your students, you’re not only sharing a cultural celebration but also teaching universal themes of courage, community, and faith that resonate with everyone.

### 10 Engaging Hanukkah Activities for Your Classroom

Here are some creative and meaningful ways to bring Hanukkah into your classroom:

#### Storytelling and Creative Expression

Introduce the story of Hanukkah to your students by sharing the tale of the Maccabees and the miracle of the oil. Then, invite students to retell the story through drawing, writing, or acting. This activity encourages creativity and helps reinforce their understanding of the holiday’s meaning.

#### Music with a Fun Twist

Play the song Candlelight by the Maccabeats, a catchy Hanukkah parody of Taio Cruz’s Dynamite. This song blends tradition with modern music, making it relatable and engaging for students. After listening, discuss the lyrics and their connection to Hanukkah traditions. You could even encourage students to write their own Hanukkah-inspired song verses!
