  Supporting teachers, and sharing ideas for supporting inclusion in diverse and
  multicultural classrooms
---

Hi! I’m Ciara, a primary school teacher and assistant principal working in a multi-denominational school in Ireland.  I am passionate about creating an inclusive classroom and school where every child feels valued, respected, and celebrated. I love to share ideas with teachers to help in supporting inclusion in diverse and multicultural classrooms.

My journey within education has led me to truly embrace the power of student voice, and value of celebrating identity and child-centered learning. I believe that when children are truly heard and actively involved in their education, magic happens. It's this philosophy that drives everything I do in my classroom and beyond.

I am the founder and creator of 'Ciara’s Classroom', a resource hub where educators can find innovative teaching strategies, classroom management tips, and tools designed to make learning more accessible and engaging for all.

Here on the blog, I'll be sharing:

- Tips for fostering a welcoming and diverse learning environment
- Book recommendations and reviews of teacher resources I love
- Practical ideas from my own classroom
- Strategies for incorporating multicultural perspectives into your curriculum
- Ideas related to Children’s Rights and Student Voice
- Resources I've created to support inclusive education
- Reflections on current trends and challenges in inclusive education

Whether you're here to read, reflect, or find some new ideas for your own classroom or school, I hope you'll find content that resonates with your passion for inclusive education.

Happy teaching!

Ciara
