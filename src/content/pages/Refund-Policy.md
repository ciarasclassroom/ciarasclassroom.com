At Ciara's Classroom, the resources you purchase are delivered electronically. Unlike a physical item, such as a t-shirt or a book, digital resources like PDFs, Word Documents, or other files cannot (really) be returned once they’ve been downloaded or accessed. For this reason, all sales of digital resources from Ciara's Classroom are considered final and nonrefundable.

However, we understand that things don't always go as planned. Therefore, we offer refunds in a few limited circumstances. If you haven’t downloaded or digitally accessed the resource, or if your purchase falls into one of the following exceptions, you may be eligible for a refund.

Refund requests must be submitted within one year of your purchase and will be granted on a case-by-case basis.

Eligible refund scenarios:

1. Compromised Resource File: The resource file is damaged or missing content.
   Example: A preview or incorrect file is uploaded instead of the actual resource.
2. Misrepresentation: The resource preview and/or description does not accurately reflect what is included in the resource. (Requests are subject to review by Ciara's Classroom.)
   Example: The product description states there are 50 multiple-choice questions, but instead, it includes 50 true/false questions.
3. Technical Limitations: You are unable to access the resource due to missing technical requirements that are not specified in the resource description.
   Example: A resource is a Notebook file, but this is not mentioned on the product page.
4. Duplicate Purchase: You purchase the same resource twice in the same account.
   Example: You buy a resource contained in a specific bundle and then later purchase the entire bundle within one year of the original purchase.
5. File Access Status: You purchased a resource but never downloaded or accessed the files (verified by Ciara's Classroom).
   Example: You purchased a resource for third grade over the summer (that you did not access) and later find out you will be teaching second grade next year.

If your purchase falls into one of these categories, you can submit a refund request by contacting us. Please be sure to include the resource name, your concerns, and any specific examples or details you have. Screenshots are welcome!
